## 🧭 Django Workflow: What Happens Behind the Scenes

Here’s the **step-by-step flow** when a user visits your site (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`):

---

### 🌀 1. User Makes a Request

When the user opens a URL in the browser, they’re making an **HTTP request** to your Django app.

**Example:**

```
GET /          (user visits homepage)
```

---

### 🔗 2. Django Looks at `urls.py`

Django checks `urls.py` in your **main project folder**:

```python
# myFirstProjectInDjango/urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

This tells Django:

> “For this route (`''` = homepage), look in `myapp/urls.py` for more specific instructions.”

---

### 📍 3. Django Checks App’s `urls.py`

Inside your app’s `urls.py`, you might have:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

This says:

> If user requests the homepage (`''`), call the `home()` function from `views.py`.

---

### 🧠 4. View Function Gets Called

```python
# myapp/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("🎉 Hello, this is your first Django app!")
```

Here’s what’s happening:

* `request`: Django passes the user’s request to the `home` function.
* `HttpResponse(...)`: This sends an actual response back to the browser — it could be plain text, HTML, JSON, etc.

## 📘 Quick Explanation of Key Terms

| Term           | What It Is                                 | Example                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `path()`       | A function to define a URL pattern         | `path('', views.home)`                            |
| `urls.py`      | Maps URLs to views                         | Think of it as a **traffic controller**           |
| `views.py`     | Defines logic for what to show on each URL | Returns `HttpResponse` or `render()` output       |
| `HttpResponse` | Sends back raw text/HTML to browser        | `HttpResponse("Hello World")`                     |
| `render()`     | Renders an HTML template with dynamic data | `render(request, 'home.html', {'name': 'Harsh'})` |
